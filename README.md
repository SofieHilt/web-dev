# My Web-Dev Repo
In this repo i'm organizing my private curriculum to keep an overview of all the topics i'm interested in and map out 
different aspects of web development in general. 
It's meant for personal organisation but if you think this might help you, feel free to take a look...

## Resources
[Here](./web-dev.wiki/resources.md) i'm tracking interesting resources about different aspects of web development. 

## Questions
Random questions i'm collecting in [this](./web-dev.wiki/questions.md) file.
